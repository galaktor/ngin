nGin (pronounced: "engine") is a .NET based game engine. I wrote what's there as a proof-of-concept for my thesis. 

The main focus was the loosely coupled architecture, the messaging system and the task scheduling.

It's by no means complete and probably not useful to anyone without serious work. It may however be interesting to poke at or draw inspiration from or learn how not to do certain things.
